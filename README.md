# SmartIoT Conference

This work is for SmartIoT conference in my PhD candidature. It was a continuing work from my previous [work](https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSPCS63175.2024.10815773)

In this work, we are investigating different types of GANs for generating augmented data for expanding and more diverse dataset for unsupervised learning. We study the effect on various GANs on IoT Anomaly Detection. 

Dataset can be found [here](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dib.2022.108473)
